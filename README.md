 ## Conditional Statements

 ![](https://www.guru99.com/images/JavaScript/javascript5_1.png)

 
  **If statement**
  - Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true


_Syntax:_

`if (condition){
lines of code to be executed if condition is true
}`


 - the if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement can be executed.


~i.e.~

`function testNum(a) {
  let result;
  if (a > 0) {
    result = 'positive';
  } else {
    result = 'NOT positive';
  }
  return result;
}
`

**If...Else Statement**


_Syntax:_

`if (condition){
lines of code to be executed if the condition is true
}else{
lines of code to be executed if the condition is false
}`
